# Scaled Societal Hierarchical Competencies

Welcome to the **Scaled Societal Hierarchical Competencies (SSHC)** project. This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of **scaled hierarchical and recursive cognitive systems**, spanning scales from the molecular to the societal and cosmic levels. By leveraging mathematical, computational, and theoretical tools, this project aims to unravel the principles underpinning such systems and their competencies.

## Introduction

The SSHC project seeks to understand how hierarchical systems evolve, adapt, and interact across scales. By integrating insights from **evolutionary dynamics**, **information theory**, **physics**, **biology**, **artificial intelligence**, and more, we aim to model and simulate the principles governing the competencies of such systems.

The project is computationally focused, utilizing **Python** as the primary programming language and combining it with mathematical and theoretical research. We aim to produce tools, papers, and insights to contribute to interdisciplinary understanding in this domain.
