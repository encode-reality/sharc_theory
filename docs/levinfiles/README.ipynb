    "**Title**: Bioelectric Gene and Reaction Networks: Computational Modelling of Genetic, Biochemical, and Bioelectrical Dynamics in Pattern Regulation  \n",
    "**Authors**: Alexis Pietak and Michael Levin  \n",
    "**Publication**: Journal of the Royal Society Interface, 2017  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary and Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "The paper develops the **Bioelectricity-Integrated Gene and Reaction (BIGR)** network framework. This framework combines **gene regulatory networks (GRNs)**, **reaction-diffusion models**, and **bioelectric signals** to study biological patterning, regeneration, and anatomical control mechanisms.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Contributions\n",
    "1. **Integration of Bioelectric Signals into GRNs**:\n",
    "   - Extends traditional GRNs to incorporate bioelectric signals such as transmembrane potential (\\(V_{mem}\\)).\n",
    "   - Models feedback loops between \\(V_{mem}\\), gene expression, and biochemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Modeling Approach**:\n",
    "   - Incorporates voltage-sensitive dynamics, ion transport, and signaling molecule interactions.\n",
    "   - Uses computational simulations to study \\(V_{mem}\\)-regulated concentration patterns, positional information, and regeneration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mechanistic Insights**:\n",
    "   - Identifies mechanisms for memory, hysteresis, and polarity regulation.\n",
    "   - Explains phenomena like axial regeneration polarity in planaria.\n",
