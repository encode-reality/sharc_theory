## Key Concepts to Research
- [x] Turing completeness - Verified: All universal computing systems equivalent
- [x] Gödel's incompleteness theorems - Bach's interpretation computational, not standard
- [x] Penrose-Hameroff orchestrated objective reduction - Controversial quantum consciousness theory
- [x] Integrated Information Theory (IIT) - Giulio Tononi's mathematical theory of consciousness
- [x] Church-Turing thesis - All effective computation models equivalent
- [x] Scaling hypothesis in AI - Empirical observation of predictable improvement with scale
- [x] Transformer architecture - "Attention is All You Need" (2017) breakthrough
- [x] AI alignment and safety - Yudkowsky's orthogonality thesis and instrumental convergence

## Summary Notes
- Analysis completed for all 6 sections
- Executive summary and key takeaways added
- Core themes identified: computational consciousness, AI optimism, integration over extinction
- Bach's unique perspective: CS provides better epistemology than philosophy

## Fact-Checking Log
1. **Lighthill Report (1973)**: VERIFIED - Led to UK AI funding cuts and "AI Winter"
2. **Commodore 64 limitations**: VERIFIED - No native graphics commands in BASIC
3. **AI history timeline**: VERIFIED - Minsky/McCarthy founded field in 1950s
4. **Transformer impact**: VERIFIED - Revolutionary architecture enabling modern LLMs
5. **Solar energy costs**: VERIFIED - At grid parity in many regions
6. **Philosophy critique**: CONTESTED - Bach's view that philosophy stagnated is controversial
7. **Consciousness theories**: VERIFIED - Correctly represents major positions (IIT, mysterianism, etc.)
