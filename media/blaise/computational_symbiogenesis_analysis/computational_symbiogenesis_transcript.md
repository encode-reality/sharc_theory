All right. Um, Mike, thanks so much for for uh for inviting me to give one of these. Um, so, um, a lot of the ideas that, um, that that I'll talk about today are, uh, are in the the what is intelligence, u book which, um, uh, which which Mike was super kind to to blurb. Um but uh but I'm going to give them a little bit of a new spin and go into some uh additional technical detail on on the on the aspects of it that are I think most relevant and and focus mostly on actually on on things that are in chapter one u of what is intelligence which is also uh the little what is life book that's on the left. So this is this is mostly a chapter one thing but I think in many ways chapter one is is the most uh groundbreaking part of this book. Uh okay. So uh the first thing that uh that I'd like to uh just I I guess establish is the relationship between life and computation. Um and uh I'm I'm going to do it uh in three ways. Uh via functionalism uh via causality and via uh the exigencies of reproduction. So uh first of all um uh let's uh let's look at the functionalist standpoint. So um you know it used to be uh in the you know before the 19th century that people thought about life uh in terms of Elan vital or some kind of you know vital spirit that makes living systems different uh from non-living systems in terms of their their underlying physics. uh that fell out of fashion of course uh as as we began to figure out how to do things like synthesize ura and um uh and realized that that the same physics underlying uh you know the atoms that make us up is make any is make a chair up or something. So that went out of fashion and we got materialism uh which is still kind of where we are today. Um you know it's it's just physics and chemistry. It's the same physics and chemistry for us as for everything else. Um that is as far as we know true. Um but it actually leaves uh a pretty a pretty big open question which is uh you know what does make us different in that case from you know from chairs uh and uh and I think the in fact I should I shouldn't actually use chairs as as my example I should use a rock on a lifeless planet and I I would say the thing that makes us different is function. ...
