- **Comparison with Robotics**:
  - Unlike biological systems, robotic systems lack inherent agendas or competencies at the component level.
  - This principle explains phenomena like cancer, where cells revert to unicellular, selfish goals due to disconnection from the organism's electrical network.

---

### **Therapeutic Implications**

### **Exploring Latent Spaces in Biology and Computation**

#### **Philosophical Perspective on Patterns**
- Introduces the concept of a **pre-existing latent space** filled with mathematical and biological patterns, inspired by Platonic philosophy.
  - Evolution and development are seen as processes exploring this latent space, not just creating random outcomes.
  - This view aligns with how mathematicians often consider themselves as discoverers, not inventors, of mathematical truths.

#### **Role of Evolution**
- Evolution uses biological forms as **pointers** to explore this latent space, connecting physical phenomena with abstract, universal forms.

  - **Delayed gratification** in task execution.
  - Ability to engage in "side quests" outside their original programmed function.
- Highlights the unpredictability of outcomes, emphasizing humility in assessing computational and biological systems.
