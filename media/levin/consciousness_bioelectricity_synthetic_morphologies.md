1. **Exploration of Consciousness and Agency:**
   - Speculative discussion on redefining consciousness.
   - Consideration of consciousness not as a property tied solely to complex brains but as possibly emergent in various biological and non-biological structures.
   - Use of cellular mechanisms and problem-solving behaviors as evidence for decentralized forms of consciousness.

2. **Biological and Non-Biological Systems:**
   - Examples like **planaria** (flatworms), which demonstrate memory retention even after decapitation, implying non-brain-based memory storage and transfer.
   - **Caterpillar-to-butterfly metamorphosis**, showcasing memory persistence and remapping during radical brain-body transformation.
   - Implications for regenerative medicine and the plasticity of memory in biological organisms.

3. **Bioelectric Networks and Morphogenesis:**
   - Examination of bioelectric signals in non-neural cells to coordinate large-scale anatomical patterning.
   - Tools like voltage-sensitive dyes to map electrical patterns and modify them to manipulate anatomical development (e.g., inducing eye formation in non-eye regions).

4. **Novel Biological Constructs:**
   - Creation of **xenobots** from frog epithelial cells that exhibit novel behaviors such as self-motility and environmental interaction without evolutionary precedent.
   - Discovery of unexpected gene expression patterns and behaviors in these constructs.

5. **Mathematical and Platonic Spaces:**
   - Hypothesis that evolutionary processes exploit mathematical patterns and structures existing in a "platonic space."
   - Evolution as a pointer to pre-existing mathematical truths, which shape both biological and cognitive patterns.

6. **Ethical and Philosophical Implications:**
   - Call for expanded ethical frameworks to interact with novel synthetic and hybrid life forms.
   - Emphasis on the continuity of cognitive abilities across biological and artificial systems, challenging traditional boundaries between life and machine.

#### Experimental Insights:
- **Behavioral Conditioning Across Systems:**
