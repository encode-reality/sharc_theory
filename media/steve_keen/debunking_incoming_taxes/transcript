And the big topline picture is that
0:03
there are going to be significant
0:06
increases on taxation of the middle
0:09
class. Number one, and the thing which
0:11
we constantly campaign for is tax the
0:14
rich. Don't tax the workers, tax the
0:16
super rich. And I think that's a good
0:18
idea, but it's also a good idea to have
0:20
a sensible model to show what's going
0:23
on. So by all means, as Gary says, focus
0:26
on taxing the rich. Focus on the rich as
0:28
well, but focus on the banks too and
0:30
understand the financial system. Well,
0:32
Gary Stevenson is a welcome addition to
0:34
the economic debate in the UK and to
0:36
some extent globally because he's
0:37
raising awareness about the major issue
0:40
that most mainstream economists
0:42
completely ignore and that's the
0:44
distribution of wealth and income in our
0:46
modern economies. We have an extremely
0:48
skewed distribution of income, worse
0:51
than it was at any time in history with
0:53
the possible exception of the what's
0:54
called the guilded age back in the end
0:56
of the 19th century. So Gary is pushing
0:59
that we should tax the rich. We must tax
1:01
the rich and here he's making a case
1:03
that if we don't there's going to be an
1:05
economic catastrophe in a very short
1:07
while. Let's have a listen and I'll
1:08
react at various points in his
1:10
presentation.
1:11
Today we are going to predict the UK
1:13
budget two and a half months in advance.
1:16
Um, if you are watching not from the UK,
1:18
this is going to be very very relevant
1:20
for you as well this year. I think
1:22
something very very interesting is going
1:24
to happen in the UK budget and I think
1:25
it's important we get ahead of it and
1:26
the big topline picture is that there
1:30
are going to be significant increases on
1:33
taxation of the middle class. Number one
1:37
and the thing which we constantly
1:39
campaign for is tax the rich. Don't tax
1:41
the workers, tax the super rich. These
1:43
are the guys who have the assets now.
1:45
These are the guys who have the
1:46
government wealth now. These are the
1:48
guys who have the working-class wealth
1:49
now and are getting the middle class
1:50
wealth. This is what I constantly
1:52
campaign for. You should tax the rich.
1:53
Um, and I think that's a good idea, but
1:56
it's also a good idea to have a sensible
1:59
model to show what's going on. Let's
2:01
just go back and take a look at the uh
2:03
when Gary is doing the mathematics here
2:05
or the arithmetic.
2:06
And we're going to use that through the
2:08
example of of an individual person,
2:09
which is maybe not the perfect example,
2:11
but I think it does does describe what's
2:13
happening. And it's important context
2:14
for why the government is doing what
2:15
it's doing now. Okay. So let's say uh
2:17
like the government in the postwar
2:19
period you start off with a lot of
2:20
wealth. So let's say Â£1 million wealth
2:22
income 50k work income 50k. But your
2:25
policy is to you're going to run this
2:27
wealth down. You're going to spend more
2:29
than your income. So you're spending
2:30
more and then obviously the consequence
2:32
of spending more than your income is
2:33
that your wealth goes down. So next year
2:35
you have only 900k wealth less than a
2:37
million. Well, there's one little saying
2:39
from a really fairly famous bloke called
2:41
Albert Einstein, and he said, and that
2:43
is keep it as simple as possible, but no
2:46
simpler. I'm sorry, but this is just too
2:48
simple. You can keep running this down,
2:50
and eventually you'll hit zero. Your
2:52
work income is 50. But it's hard now,
2:55
right? Because you're used to spending
2:56
200 a year, but we started to overspend
2:58
even with no wealth left. And we started
3:00
to run into debt. Then your wealth
3:01
income can become negative. Like, not
3:03
only do you have no wealth, but you have
3:05
to pay interest on your debt to the
3:06
rich. So now this is minus 25. If we
3:09
keep lending these guys money, they're
3:10
not going to be able to pay it back.
3:12
This naivity to the aggressive falls in
3:15
government wealth leads to a situation
3:17
where obviously inevitably eventually
3:20
you will run out of wealth and you will
3:22
have to aggressively reduce your
3:23
spending. Finally, with this choice that
3:25
our UK government has now, your
3:27
government will have very soon, which is
3:29
you only have two options. Do you tax
3:31
the rich or do you tax the middle class?
3:33
And I presume he did this with a
3:36
spreadsheet first off. So I've made a
3:37
little copy of the spreadsheet logic
3:39
that he has to have here. And that's
3:41
saying using initial wealth. It's his
3:43
example of starting with a million
3:44
pounds getting a 5% return. You're
3:47
spending 50,000 a year. Uh and you spend
3:50
200,000. So if you do that, you start
3:52
with a million in wealth. Uh you earn
3:55
another 100,000. You spend 200,000. So
3:58
that uh year you end up reducing your
4:01
wealth by 100,000. And that's the fall
4:03
of wealth shown over here. And then
4:05
having got to the second year of the
4:07
whole process or the third year uh use
4:10
you reduce your wealth by another 105.
4:12
So you've got 795,000
4:15
684 which is the last figure that Gary
4:17
wrote down there. And ultimately you end
4:19
up with negative wealth which is what he
4:21
says we're heading heading for at some
4:23
point. And I want to show what it looks
4:25
like when you put it in a more
4:26
sophisticated program where you can
4:28
actually model the flows that happen
4:30
that are being ignored in this analysis.
4:32
And that's my Ravvel software here. And
4:34
then I'm going to reproduce the crisis
4:36
that Gary sees coming in his spreadsheet
4:38
example there. So we're going to start
4:40
off with uh I've got 1,600 inside there
4:42
rather than uh 1 million, but that'll do
4:44
for the moment. And what I have first of
4:46
all, the government spends on both the
4:48
rich and the poor. I've got the
4:50
government spending say 20% of its
4:52
spending on the rich and 80% on the
4:54
poor, which is reasonably accurate. Uh
4:56
but only taxing the poor. So the tax
4:58
comes back from the poor. You've got tax
4:59
the rich here as well. But that switch
5:01
hasn't been clicked. So the tax burden
5:04
on the on the rich is going to be zero
5:05
when I start running this simulation.
5:07
Now one of the rules of government
5:09
spending is that the government is
5:11
required by laws not by accounting but
5:13
by laws that have been passed by
5:15
politicians uh to issue bonds equivalent
5:18
to the deficit. So the excess of
5:20
spending over over tax taxation income
5:22
plus interest on existing bonds. That's
5:24
another part of the program. I've done
5:26
that having run a deficit and I've got
5:27
the government running just up here.
5:29
I've got them spending 31% of GDP and
5:31
taxing 30% back. So, it's only a very
5:34
small deficit on historical standards,
5:36
1% of GDP, but we'll see what happens to
5:38
that anyway. Um, so with that, it has to
5:41
issue bonds equivalent to 1% of GDP
5:43
initially and then it's got to pay
5:45
interest on those bonds and that
5:46
accumulates over time and I can see the
5:48
numbers here. So, I can tell Ravevel
5:50
here to show me the numbers that are
5:52
passing through the sheets there. So I
5:54
turn that on and now I can see that with
5:56
this initial situation where the uh
5:58
government is running a 1% of GDP
6:01
deficit. Then it's spending $992
6:04
per year out of a GDP of about 3,600 I
6:08
think. And then that's 198 going on the
6:10
rich, 794 on the on the poor. You're
6:13
taxing the rich the poor 960 taxing the
6:15
rich zero. What's going to happen over
6:17
time? You're spending less on the poor
6:19
than you're taxing them. Their account's
6:21
going to go down towards zero. And we'll
6:22
see that happening. Equally over here
6:24
you're spending on the rich but you're
6:26
not taxing them and you're then selling
6:27
them bonds. Now of course that takes the
6:29
money out of their account but it gives
6:30
them bonds on which they earn interest.
6:32
So that actually helps their accounts
6:34
accumulate over time. So let's run this
6:36
model and see what happens. The red line
6:37
is the poor and it ain't long before the
6:39
poor have got nothing at all because
6:41
they're being tax more than they're
6:42
having government spending going on
6:43
them. The poor are broke and that's the
6:45
situation that Gary's saying we've
6:46
already reached at the end of the
6:48
current uh system. But let's okay let's
6:50
now tax the rich. So I turn tax the rich
6:52
on. I'll just recalculate there. And now
6:54
you can see the rich are paying some
6:55
tax. So it's still the same level of
6:57
government spending at the start. 992
7:00
million or billion, whatever numbers
7:01
you're working with. Uh 800 on tax on
7:04
the poor. Uh but 160 on the rich and
7:07
then you're also selling bonds to them.
7:09
So you just slightly spend slightly more
7:11
on them than you tax them and then they
7:14
buy bonds off you. But then you've got
7:15
to start paying interest to them. So
7:17
what's happens now when you run this run
7:18
this system? Oh, you see there's much
7:20
less change in the amount of money in
7:21
the accounts because you're not taking
7:22
as much out of the poor accounts. You're
7:24
taking a bit out of the rich, but you're
7:26
putting more into them than you're
7:27
taking out initially because you're
7:29
spending on them, but now because you're
7:31
also paying them interest income. And
7:33
notice what's happening. Even though
7:35
you're taxing the rich now, you still
7:37
have an explosion in level of government
7:39
debt to GDP. So after 30 years, it's
7:42
gone from zero in this hypothetical
7:44
example to 100% of GDP at 35 years,
7:48
120%, interest payments are becoming
7:50
impossible. At some stage, as Gary says
7:52
in the video, the rich are going to say,
7:54
"This is a bad game. We're not going to
7:55
continue playing this game. We won't buy
7:57
your bonds and bang, your economy is
7:59
going to fall over." That's the crisis
8:01
that Gary sees coming the way of the
8:03
world unless we do both taxing the rich
8:06
and also get them back and and stop
8:08
running a deficit. But that has a
8:09
strange effect here because if you stop
8:11
running the deficit, watch what happens.
8:12
You're not giving as much money to the
8:13
poor anymore. So they end up going
8:15
bankrupt again. So austerity is going to
8:18
mean a disaster no matter what. You
8:20
might then try to spend a bit to try to
8:22
come back into balance again. But it's a
8:24
really difficult game because as you do
8:25
this, you're increasing the debt levels.
8:27
We've already hit 2,000% of GDP. This is
8:30
not a sustainable economy. But I've got
8:32
some good news. This is not the economy
8:34
we live in either. There's a big mistake
8:35
being made here. And Gary is doing
8:38
exactly the same thing that mainstream
8:40
economists who don't worry about wealth
8:42
as much as he does. He's making the same
8:44
mistake they do of thinking that the
8:46
government is just like a household. And
8:48
his example in fact was talking about an
8:50
individual with that wealth and running
8:52
it down. He's using exactly the same
8:54
analogy for the government. And that is
8:56
a mistake in terms of the structure of
8:58
the financial system of every country on
9:01
the planet. Notice what I've got here.
9:03
This is seeing the banks as the avenue
9:05
through which we distribute money
9:07
around. And it's got the poor and the
9:09
rich and the government all banking with
9:11
the private banks. Now the poor do, the
9:13
rich do as well as elsewhere. Of course,
9:15
the government, yes, it has some bank
9:17
accounts there, but overwhelmingly it
9:19
banks at the central bank, the Bank of
9:21
England in the UK's case. Notice the
9:23
debt doesn't turn up here. Uh the reason
9:25
for that is that the government debt in
9:27
this vision of how the economy operates
9:29
is owned by the rich. So you sell the
9:31
bonds to the rich. uh that's happening
9:33
here. You pay interest on the bonds to
9:35
the rich. Doesn't go anywhere near the
9:36
banks. Now, that's completely wrong. And
9:39
this is a mistake. Gary's not the only
9:40
one that makes it. Unfortunately, he's
9:42
got a lot of company. Is that I've set
9:44
exactly the same uh parameters into the
9:46
system. But I've made the point that the
9:49
government doesn't borrow from the
9:51
non-bank uh public. It borrows from the
9:53
banks. It sell rather it sells the
9:55
bonds. When the government initially
9:57
issues bonds to cover its deficit as
9:59
it's required to by law, it sells those
10:01
bonds. in what's called the primary bond
10:03
auction in America or guilt auctions in
10:05
the UK. And to be part of those
10:07
auctions, you've got to either be a bank
10:09
or have an account at the at the Bank of
10:11
England to enable you to do the buying.
10:12
You buy that at what we call reserve
10:14
accounts. So the purchase when they're
10:16
made, run down the reserve account. So
10:18
you run the reser reserves down, you get
10:20
the bonds in return, and then the
10:21
interest payments are made to the banks
10:23
and that's how banks do spending. You
10:25
might notice, you might have missed it
10:26
here that I've got bank spending here,
10:28
but I've got bank spending with no money
10:30
in their bank account. So they don't
10:31
spend anything. So all I've done is say,
10:33
let's just shift things around a bit and
10:35
say that in fact the banks are the ones
10:36
who buy the bonds in the initial
10:38
auctions. They're the ones who get the
10:40
interest payments. They're the ones who
10:41
spend. And I'm starting from the same
10:43
point of view. No taxing of the rich.
10:45
Spending the spending fraction of GDP
10:47
being 31%. So you've got a 1% of GDP
10:50
deficit. Let's run this model and see
10:52
what happens. And the rich end up being
10:53
screwed. So the poor get screwed just as
10:55
fast in this model. So another one of
10:57
Gary's points, you've got to tax the
10:58
rich as well. Well, let's turn on taxing
11:00
the rich and start the whole thing over
11:02
again. And again, notice we've got the
11:05
same rough situation as you saw
11:07
beforehand, the slow rundown of the
11:08
amount of money that the poor have in
11:10
their bank accounts. Two things which
11:11
are very different about this situation
11:13
is first of all, government debt's not
11:15
rising anywhere near as quickly. In
11:16
fact, you'll notice it's starting to
11:18
taper and then government interest
11:19
payments are doing the same thing. And
11:21
the reason that's happening is that the
11:23
the spending of the government is
11:25
actually increasing the amount of money
11:26
in the economy. This was left out of
11:28
that simple spreadsheet that Gary put
11:29
together where there's just a certain
11:30
amount of wealth and you spend it down.
11:32
Inevitably you're going to hit zero. But
11:34
in the real world, and this is what we
11:36
need to be thinking in terms of, not the
11:38
toy models of mainstream economist, and
11:40
Gary fundamentally is using the same
11:42
model there. We want to model the real
11:44
world. And in the real world, borrowing
11:45
by firms from banks creates money. The
11:48
government spending more than it takes
11:49
back in taxation also creates money. So
11:52
here I'm running this model for a longer
11:53
period. You can see the debt ratio is
11:55
stabilized. There is no crisis. The
11:57
interest payments have also stabilized.
11:59
Again, no crisis. And even the poor now
12:02
in this model, initially they saw the
12:03
amount of money in their bank accounts
12:05
going down. Now it's rising with the
12:07
rest even though the level of spending
12:09
on them for a while was below the level
12:11
of uh taxation that was being applied to
12:13
them. So by all means, as Gary says,
12:15
focus on taxing the rich. Focus on the
12:17
rich as well, but focus on the banks too
12:20
and understand the financial system. And
12:22
when you do that, you see, yes, you
12:23
should tax the rich. that turned up in
12:25
this model as well. But the main thing
12:27
you have to be aware of is that
12:29
government spending creates money. Now
12:31
it obviously it's important to spend
12:33
those things on sensible things like new
12:35
roads, transportation system, schools,
12:37
the national health system, not bombing
12:40
other countries, which is a large way
12:41
that the government does spend its money
12:43
these days. That's what the government
12:45
should be doing. So yes, by all means,
12:47
join Gary in supporting the idea of
12:48
taxing the wealthy. But Gary, join us in
12:51
understanding the banking system and
12:53
seeing that you don't face that
12:54
catastrophe when you understand
12:56
government finances properly.
