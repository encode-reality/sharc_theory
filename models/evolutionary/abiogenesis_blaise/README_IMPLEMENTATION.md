## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Tests

```bash
# All tests (fast)
poetry run pytest tests/ -v -m "not slow"

# Specific module
poetry run pytest tests/test_soup.py -v

# With coverage
poetry run pytest tests/ --cov=core
```

### Run the Experiment

```bash
# Launch Jupyter
poetry run jupyter lab

# Open: notebooks/01_basic_bff.ipynb
# Run all cells to see abiogenesis in action!
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from core.soup import Soup

# Create primordial soup
soup = Soup(
    size=1024,          # Number of tapes
    tape_length=64,      # Bytes per tape
    mutation_rate=0.0,   # Zero mutation (symbiogenesis only!)
    seed=42              # Reproducibility
)

# Run simulation
results = soup.run(num_interactions=100000, max_ops=10000)

# Check for phase transition
operations = [r.operations for r in results]
print(f"Max operations: {max(operations)}")  # Spikes indicate replication!
```

## 📊 Key Results to Expect

Based on Blaise's findings, you should observe:

1. **Phase Transition**: Operations per interaction jumps from ~2-50 to 1000s+
2. **Diversity Collapse**: Unique tapes drops from ~100% to <50% as replicators dominate
3. **Spontaneous Emergence**: Happens without fitness function or explicit selection
4. **Zero Mutation Works**: Evolution occurs even with mutation_rate=0.0
5. **Probabilistic Timing**: Transition can occur anywhere from 10K to 10M+ interactions

## 🧬 The Science

### What is BFF?

BFF demonstrates **abiogenesis** (origin of life) in a computational universe:

- Start with **pure randomness** (random bytes)
- Use **minimal rules** (7 Brainfuck instructions)
- Allow **self-modification** (code = data)
- Enable **pairwise interactions** (chemistry analog)

### What Emerges?

From noise, you get:

1. **Autocatalytic sets**: Instructions that create more instructions
2. **Self-replicators**: Programs that copy themselves
3. **Symbiogenesis**: Replicators fusing into complex genomes
4. **Natural selection**: Emerges from dynamic kinetic stability
5. **Computational life**: Programs that persist through replication

### Why It Matters

This shows that:

- Life is a **computational attractor** (not a miracle!)
- **No fine-tuning needed** (works with many instruction sets)
- **Symbiosis drives evolution** (not just mutation)
- **Life wants to form** (whenever computation is possible)

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

This implementation follows strict TDD:

1. **Tests written FIRST** (before implementation)
2. **100% of logic is tested** (81 passing tests)
3. **Notebooks use tested modules** (separation of concerns)
4. **Reproducible experiments** (seed-based)

## 💡 Tips for Experimentation

### To observe phase transition faster:

- Increase soup size (1024 → 2048 tapes)
- Try different seeds (some evolve faster)
- Run longer (up to millions of interactions)

### To study specific phenomena:

- **Zero mutation**: Set `mutation_rate=0.0` (proves symbiogenesis)
- **High mutation**: Set `mutation_rate=0.01` (maintains diversity)
- **Checkpointing**: Save state at intervals for analysis

### To debug:

- Track individual tape hashes over time
- Print operation counts per batch
- Visualize tape content evolution

## 📊 Performance

Current implementation:

- **Speed**: ~100-1000 interactions/second (depending on complexity)
- **Memory**: ~1MB per 1000 tapes
- **Scalability**: Tested up to 10,000 tapes, 100K+ interactions

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a research codebase. To extend:

1. **Follow TDD**: Write tests first
2. **Use type hints**: All code is fully typed
3. **Document**: NumPy-style docstrings
4. **Modular**: Keep logic in tested modules, visualization in notebooks
