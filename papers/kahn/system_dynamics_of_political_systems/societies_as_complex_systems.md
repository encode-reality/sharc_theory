## **A Functionalist–Constructivist Theory of Agency, Power, and Dissipation in Complex Societies**

### **1. First Principles: Open Systems and Dynamic Equilibrium**

Human societies are **open, non-equilibrium systems**: they do not converge to static equilibrium but persist by maintaining **dynamic stability** through continuous exchange of energy, matter, and information with their environment. This principle is foundational in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and applies to biological, ecological, and social systems alike [1][2].

Such systems sustain internal order by importing low-entropy resources and exporting higher-entropy byproducts. Order is therefore not created ex nihilo; it is maintained at the cost of increased disorder elsewhere [1][3].

From a **functionalist** perspective, a system is defined by the internal variables it must regulate to persist. From a **constructivist** perspective, the mechanisms that perform this regulation—institutions, norms, laws—are historically evolved or intentionally designed solutions to recurrent coordination and stability problems [4][5].

### **2. Resource Throughput and the Enablement of Agency**

Let **resource throughput** denote the rate at which a society ingests usable inputs such as energy, materials, labor, capital, and information. Resource inflow does not itself constitute power; rather, it **enables agency**, understood as the system’s capacity to act upon and modify its environment [3][6].

**Agency**, defined functionally, is:

> *The capacity of a subsystem to convert resources into actions that modify shared environmental or institutional conditions.*

Agency is distributed across at least three interacting macro-subsystems:

* an **economic subsystem** (production, firms, capital),
* a **political subsystem** (state authority, law, enforcement),
* a **constituent subsystem** (citizens, labor, civil society).

Uneven growth in agency across these subsystems is a predictable outcome of differential access to resources, technology, and organizational capacity [6][7].

### **3. Power as Agency Differential**

Power is not synonymous with agency. Power emerges when **agency differentials** allow one subsystem to **asymmetrically alter the boundary conditions** of another. In this sense, power is a *relational property*, not an intrinsic one [8][9].

Formally:

* Agency is a latent capacity.
* Power is the realized gradient of that capacity across subsystem boundaries.

This formulation parallels the role of gradients (temperature, voltage, chemical potential) in physical systems, which generate directed flows and perform work [1][2]. In social systems, such gradients produce **political, economic, or coercive work**, reshaping institutional constraints and allocation rules [9][10].

### **4. Destabilizing Work and the Necessity of Dissipation**

When agency gradients grow unchecked, the work they perform becomes **destabilizing**. Complex systems theory predicts that such conditions lead to positive feedback, lock-in, and eventual loss of adaptability unless counteracted by damping mechanisms [2][4].

**Dissipation** is therefore a necessary structural function. It consists of processes that **degrade concentrated power into forms that cannot sustain unilateral dominance**, such as:

* procedural delay,
* institutional friction,
* transparency and disclosure,
* contestation,
* redundancy and pluralism,
* stochastic outcomes (elections, judicial review).

This mirrors the role of entropy production in physical dissipative structures, where energy gradients are degraded to preserve macroscopic order [1][2][3].

### **5. Internal Stability and Entropy Externalization**

A core implication of open-systems theory is that systems **prioritize internal stability over external stability**. This is not a normative choice but a functional necessity: internal disorder threatens system persistence, whereas external disorder may be survivable [1][3][11].

Accordingly, systems regulate internal variables by **externalizing destabilizing effects**:

* firms externalize costs through pollution and risk transfer,
* states externalize instability through conflict, sanctions, or capital flows,
* political systems externalize conflict into slow, procedural channels such as courts and elections.

This pattern is well-established across cybernetics, ecology, and political economy and reflects the general principle that regulation requires exporting entropy to the environment [3][5][11].

### **6. Triadic Balance and Democratic Stability**

In democratic-capitalist societies, stability depends on **bounded antagonism** among economic, political, and constituent subsystems. Each subsystem both constrains and dissipates excess agency arising in the others [7][12].

Institutions such as campaign finance regulation, separation of powers, federalism, judicial review, disclosure regimes, and electoral competition function as **dissipative structures**. Their role is to regulate cross-boundary agency flows and prevent any single subsystem from entering a runaway positive-feedback regime [4][5][12].

When dissipative capacity is weakened—through institutional erosion, legal reinterpretation, or technological amplification—agency gradients steepen, power accumulates, and systemic equilibrium degrades predictably into capture, rigidity, or instability [2][7][12].

---

### **7. Constructivist Implication: Institutions as Control Structures**

From a constructivist standpoint, social institutions are best understood as **engineered control mechanisms** embedded within a non-equilibrium system. They are adaptive solutions to the invariant problem of maintaining stability under conditions of growth, innovation, and unequal agency expansion [4][6].

Thus:

* markets are not merely allocative devices,
* democracy is not merely a moral arrangement,
* law is not merely normative constraint.

They are **functional components of a dissipative architecture** that allows societies to expand agency while preserving dynamic equilibrium [5][6][12].

---

### **Conclusion**

Complex societies maintain dynamic equilibrium by ingesting low-entropy resources to enable agency while dissipating the destabilizing power gradients that agency produces. Power is not eliminated; it is degraded, redistributed, delayed, and rendered contestable. Failure to maintain sufficient dissipative capacity leads, by structural necessity rather than historical accident, to runaway dominance, systemic capture, or collapse. This dynamic follows directly from first principles governing all open, adaptive systems.
