# Glossary (living document)

- Abstraction: A representation that omits micro‑details while preserving macro‑relevant structure for a task or scale.
- Representation (mapping): A principled correspondence between abstract states and physical states that preserves relevant structure.
- Invariance: A property or pattern that remains unchanged under specified transformations (e.g., time‑evolution plus translation for a glider).
- Dynamic invariant: A pattern that persists through continuous update by compensating local changes with rule‑guided restoration.
- Scale invariance: Similar structure or lawful relationships observed across multiple spatial/temporal scales, often revealed by coarse‑graining.
- Redundancy: Structured duplication that increases reliability under noise; includes error correction and degeneracy.
- Entropy (informational): Uncertainty or dispersion of probability over states; thermodynamically linked to heat and energy dissipation.
- Persistent computation: A physical process that maintains and transforms information reliably over time by combining organized dynamics, redundancy, and energy throughput.
- Counterfactual support: The property that alternative admissible inputs would lead to appropriately different outputs under the same dynamics.
- Dynamic kinetic stability (DKS): Persistence arising from ongoing turnover and replication under non‑equilibrium conditions.
- Edge of chaos: Regime between order and turbulence where systems exhibit metastable structure and rich interactions conducive to computation.

Note: Terms will be tightened as Section 5 (framework) is drafted.
 
Additional terms (Section 5)
- Coarse‑graining: A mapping from micro‑states to macro‑states that preserves effective degrees of freedom relevant at a scale.
- Persistence time/length (L_p): Maximum horizon over which information about abstract state is predictively retained above a threshold.
- Redundancy density (ρ_R): Fraction of resources (space/time/energy) allocated to redundancy and error control.
- Energy throughput (P_E) / energy flux (J_E): Rate at which a system consumes energy to sustain computation.
- Entropy production (Σ): Irreversible entropy generated by the computation per unit time or operation.
- Resilience function (R(Δ)): Tolerated disturbance Δ while keeping error within budget.
