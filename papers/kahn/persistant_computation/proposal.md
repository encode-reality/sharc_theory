# Proposal — Unifying Automata Theory, Universal Computation, and Scale‑Invariant Dynamics

Sources:
- `papers/kahn/persistant_computation/outline_structure.md`
- `papers/kahn/persistant_computation/Unifying Automata Theory, Universal Computation, and Scale-Invariant Dynamics.pdf`

Purpose
- Produce a publication‑ready paper that unifies automata theory, universal computation, and scale‑invariant dynamics via a “persistent computation” framework grounded in thermodynamics and information theory.
- Write section‑by‑section, keeping all artifacts in this folder, with your approval before drafting each major block.

Working Title
- Primary: Unifying Automata Theory, Universal Computation, and Scale‑Invariant Dynamics
- Alternate (from outline): Computation as Persistence: Scale‑Invariant Dynamics and Entropy Resistance Across Systems

Audience and Candidate Venues (choose one)
- Complex systems and information physics audiences
- Options: Entropy (MDPI), Complex Systems (Wolfram), Foundations of Science, or arXiv preprint first

Target Length and Format
- 6–10 pages main text, plus figures and references; Markdown first, optional LaTeX export later.

Section Plan (for approval)
1. Abstract (written last)
2. Introduction
   - Problem: fragmented views across computation, physics, biology, cognition
   - Thesis: persistence = computation under scale‑invariant dynamics resisting entropy
3. Foundations and Related Work
   - Automata and Universality (Turing, lambda, CA; Rule 110, Life)
   - Computation as Physical Interaction (Landauer; Church‑Turing‑Deutsch; digital physics)
   - Non‑trivial physical computation (criteria; causal isomorphism; counterfactuals)
4. Emergence and Scale Invariance
   - Dynamic invariants (gliders; Class IV; edge of chaos)
   - Cross‑scale analogies and phase transitions between organizational levels
5. Persistent Computation: A Unified Framework (contribution)
   - Formal criteria: substrate, state transitions, redundancy/error correction, self‑representation/replication, energy throughput
   - Hierarchical composition and scale‑invariant structure
6. Entropy, Redundancy, and Stability
   - Thermodynamics of information; redundancy as entropy‑defying mechanism; DKS
   - Sketches: error rate vs redundancy; energy cost vs persistence probability
7. Incompleteness, Control, and Adaptation
   - Gödel/halting and governance/control analogies via requisite variety
   - Open systems as continual re‑computation to address incompleteness
8. Discussion and Implications
   - Origin of life; AI/self‑organizing computation; societal stability
   - Falsifiability: measurable signatures (entropy–information ratios; redundancy density vs lifespan)
9. Limitations and Open Questions
10. Conclusion

Planned Figures and Tables (initial)
- CA glider as dynamic invariant; scale mapping diagram across layers; redundancy vs error curves; conceptual framework schematic.

Methodology and Evidence
- Literature‑anchored synthesis; toy CA or agent‑based sketches where helpful; clear falsifiability criteria.

Style and Citations
- Lean, precise prose; minimal jargon; inline references with consistent style. Default to numeric unless you choose author‑year.

Approval Checklist (please mark in comments or edit this file)
- Approve section plan and title choice
- Choose venue and citation style
- Approve figure list (add/remove items)
- Confirm acceptable level of formalism (conceptual vs math‑forward)

Next Steps After Approval
1) Lock section headers and glossary
2) Draft Sections 3–4 (Foundations; Emergence)
3) Draft Section 5 (Persistent Computation framework)
4) Draft Sections 6–7 (Entropy/Redundancy; Incompleteness/Control)
5) Draft Discussion → then Introduction, Abstract, Title

Notes
- Worklog: `papers/kahn/persistant_computation/WORKLOG.md` (kept up to date)
- All outputs remain in this folder for easy review and versioning.
